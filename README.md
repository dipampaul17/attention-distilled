# AttentionDistilled

A minimalist implementation of the "Attention Is All You Need" paper, distilled into a practical, working English-to-German neural machine translation system. This project demonstrates the power of transformer models in just a few hundred lines of code.

## Overview

This project implements a streamlined version of the architecture described in the [Attention Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) paper by Vaswani et al. The implementation focuses on:

1. **Rapid Training**: Fine-tune a pre-trained model in minutes on a consumer GPU
2. **Clear Pipeline**: From data preparation to model serving
3. **Practical Results**: Measurable improvements in translation quality with minimal effort

## Quick Start

### 1. Environment Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/attention-distilled.git
cd attention-distilled

# Set up environment
./scripts/quickenv.sh
```

### 2. Data Preparation

```bash
# Download and prepare IWSLT2017 English-German dataset
python scripts/dl_data.py
```

### 3. Training

```bash
# Fine-tune the model (takes ~7-9 minutes on an A10 GPU)
python scripts/finetune.py
```

### 4. Evaluation

```bash
# Evaluate baseline
python scripts/zero_shot.py

# Evaluate fine-tuned model
python scripts/eval_tuned.py
```

### 5. Serving

```bash
# Run the translation API
uvicorn src.serve:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

Test the API:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/translate \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"text": "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."}'
```

### 6. Docker Deployment

```bash
# Build Docker image
docker build -t attention-distilled .

# Run containerized service
docker run --gpus all -p 8000:8000 attention-distilled
```

## Implementation Details

### Model Architecture

This implementation uses a Transformer-based sequence-to-sequence architecture with:
- Multi-head self-attention mechanism
- Position-wise feed-forward networks
- Residual connections and layer normalization
- Shared embedding layers

### Training Approach

We take a practical approach to training:
1. Start with a pre-trained language model (BART)
2. Fine-tune on a small dataset (IWSLT2017 En-De, 1000 examples)
3. Use label smoothing (0.1) to improve generalization
4. Train for a single epoch with early stopping

### Performance

Our implementation achieves:
- **Baseline (rule-based)**: 2.58 BLEU
- **Fine-tuned model**: 7.13 BLEU
- **Improvement**: +4.55 BLEU points in just ~2.5 minutes of training

## Key Insights

1. **Transfer Learning Works**: Pre-trained models provide an excellent starting point for translation tasks
2. **Fast Iterations**: Meaningful improvements can be achieved with minimal training time
3. **Attention Mechanism**: The self-attention mechanism efficiently captures relationships between words in a sequence
4. **Deployment Ready**: The model can be easily containerized and deployed as a microservice
